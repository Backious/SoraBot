**Date**
4.2.2017

**Changes**
  - ADDED BETA OF STARBOARD! How to use:
		set a channel in which sora should post the star reactions with $star
		remove the said channel with $starremove
		(Setting and removing the channel needs manageChannels permissions!)
		
		To add a post in the StarBoard just add a star reaction to a message (either `:star:` or `:star2:`)
		(needs no permission. Keep in mind you cannot add your own message to the starboard!)
  - Fixed some bugs
